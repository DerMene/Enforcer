The Enforcer AST transform Enforce allows you to put enforcer checks on methods, and classes, making then distinguishable from the main logic as business rule/security checks.

=== How the Enforce AST Transform was built

The Enforce Transform was built in the testAst project:

https://github.com/virtualdogbert/testAst[Enforcer testAST github]

Using the ./scripts/_Events.groovy eventCompileStart hook to precompile the Enforce transform. If you import this project into Intellij You will be
able to set break points in the AST transform, and Intellij will pick them up, which make debugging AST transforms a lot easier.  I also used the
Groovy/Grails Console, and the Inspect AST mode to see, what statements and expressions make up the code I wanted to write. At some point I will
upgrade the project to use Grails 3, and use gradle rather then the _Events.groovy.
